## Functional Purpose
1. Provide a central repository of useful and reusable code.
1. Create generalised and reusable configuration

## Non-Functional Purpose
1. First and foremost... Make my day-to-day life simpler.
1. Second, to ensure I save useful and reusable code for posterity.
1. But after all that, make what I think is useful code available to the people's of the internet, and to allow, and potentially, accept feedback on ways things could be done better.
